An implementation of a Five Staged Pipelined CPU in Verilog. The CPU was designed to execute [MIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_instruction_set) instructions which are 32 bit binary words consisting of an op-code and an operand. MIPS has 3 major forms of instructions - R-type, I-type and J-type.
